# ToyFinder

ToyFinder is my first CLI gem project at Flatiron School. It will pull specialized toys and gadgets from funandfunction.com to aid parents and caregivers in caring for kids with special needs. When the gem is initialized, the user will be greeted with an inspirational/encouraging “Quote of the day” and presented with a list of toys/gadgets (based on specialized use) to choose from. Each option will display the specified toy and give specifics on the name, price, and further description of the product. Upon completed of the transaction, the user can exit the program.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:
```ruby
gem 'toy_finder'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install toy_finder

## Usage

From the local directory execute:
        $ toyfinder
     and follow the prompts to run the program.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
